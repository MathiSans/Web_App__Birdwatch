## GIT

### **Case 1# (CLOSED): Main/Branch**

Git branch is set to `branchname:main`. Pushing the branch will push changes to the main.

**QUESTION:** How to change the branch settings so that a push will be directed towards the alternative branch and not the main?

**ANSWER:** To prevent git to push from a branch to the main branch (e.g. _branchname:main_) type `git push -u origin branch` and hit enter.

## CSS

### **object-fit**

With `object-fit` an image or video can be scalled and tweaked within it's own element. [(MDN Doc)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit?retiredLocale=de)

### **-inline/-block**

`-inline` or `-inline-start/-end` changes for example with margin or padding the spacing on the horizontal axis; `-block`or `-block-start/-end` does the same on the vertical axis.

Examples:

- `margin-inline: 1rem`
- `margin-inline-start: 1rem`
- the first example changes the value on the left and right; the second example changes the value only on the left
