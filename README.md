## GIT

**Case 1# (CLOSED):** Git branch is set to `branchname:main`. Pushing the branch will push changes to the main.

**QUESTION:** How to change the branch settings so that a push will be directed towards the alternative branch and not the main?

**ANSWER:** To prevent git to push from a branch to the main branch (e.g. _branchname:main_) type `git push -u origin branch` and hit enter.
